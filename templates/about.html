                <p>The model used is XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for high performance in classification tasks.</p>
                <h5>Training Details:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyperparameters (Optimized via GridSearchCV):</strong> learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5, n_estimators=100.</li>
                    <li><strong>Features:</strong> Gender, Height, Weight, Systolic BP (ap_hi), Diastolic BP (ap_lo), Cholesterol, Glucose, Smoke, Alcohol, Active, Age (years), Pulse Pressure, BMI.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Converted age from days to years; calculated BMI (weight / (height/100)^2); computed pulse pressure (ap_hi - ap_lo); standardized numeric features using StandardScaler.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Data:</strong> Split from cleaned cardio_train.csv (X_train, y_train).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The model was trained on a balanced dataset (50% with/without cardio disease) and evaluates binary classification (0 = Low Risk, 1 = High Risk).</p>
